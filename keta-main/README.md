# Knowledge Evaluation Test - Angular

As an user I would like to have a tool that allows me to create and manage important notes to me.

**Acceptance Criteria**

- I want to create notes;
- I want to delete notes;
- I want to edit notes;
- I want to see all my notes;
- I want to see one specific note;
- I want a cool layout that works nice on mobile and desktop devices;
- I want to filter the notes via `title` or `content` ir order to find one or more notes with my searching criteria (text);
- I want to change the order of my notes from the newest to the oldest or from A-Z to Z-A (using `title` as the alphabetical reference).

**Extra Information**

- The user does not know what he wants for layout. So, feel free to be creative and surprise the user with a cool layout.

- Unit tests are **not** required. But having them will be a very good extra.

- You're going to find a template project bellow. The usate of this template is requested. Otherwise your code will not be evaluated.

- You're receiving a [Postman collection](./KETA.postman_collection.json) (listed bellow on "Assets"). Use it as your reference.

- The delivery must be done in a Github public repository. It can be a fork of the [project template](https://github.com/HDeiro/angular-base) or a new repo.
